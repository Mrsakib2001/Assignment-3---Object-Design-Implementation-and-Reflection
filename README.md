# AWE Electronics – Online Store (Assignment 3)

This project is a front-end implementation of an online electronics store for AWE Electronics, developed for SWE30003: Software Architectures and Design (Assignment 3). It demonstrates how an object-oriented design can be translated into a working web application using core web technologies.

## Purpose

The goal of this system is to simulate an online shopping experience for AWE Electronics, a retail store expanding to an online presence. Key operations include customer login, product browsing, shopping cart management, and basic administrative reporting.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript 

No external libraries or frameworks are used. The project is structured using a simplified Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.

## File Structure

- `index.html` – Main entry point and layout of the application
- `css/styles.css` – Stylesheet for layout and visual design
- `js/auth.js` – Handles user registration and login
- `js/products.js` – Contains product data
- `js/products-ui.js` – Renders the product catalogue
- `js/cart.js` – Manages the shopping cart logic
- `js/admin.js` – Displays admin dashboard features
- `js/navigation.js` – Controls view transitions
- `js/main.js` – Main controller and app startup logic

## How to Run

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
3. No server setup is required. All functionality runs client-side using JavaScript.

## Features Demonstrated

- User registration and login with validation
- Product catalogue display with dynamic interaction
- Shopping cart with real-time updates and localStorage persistence
- Admin dashboard showing stock summaries
- Input validation and basic error handling

## Notes

This project was developed without a back-end. Features such as payment and delivery tracking are simulated using placeholder messages. The focus was on implementing a clear, modular architecture and demonstrating core business functionality.
